# ** Introduction **

Stock Securities trade forecast this is applied to expect destiny estimation of inventory price. Stock put it on the market expectation facilitates for each consumer and provider of inventory. The powerful forecast of a inventory’s destiny fee should go back noteworthy gain for each consumer and seller. This might advocate that each one freely recognized statistic approximately an organization. Which surely contains its cost history, might as of now be contemplated with inside the gift value of the inventory. To foresee the inventory value of the precise organization we want get the chronicled inventory cost facts of that company. Using the verifiable facts we will expect the inventory open value of the day. Predicting the inventory fee in python application utilizing system mastering
algorithm. Support Vector Regression and Linear Regression calculation are applied to
foresee the inventory price. Prediction is accomplished depending on real inventory fee of the company. The application will peruse the precise employer inventory records and make the forecast of the open fee of the day. The inventory trade is basically a conglomeration of various clients and sellers of inventory. The enterprise to determine the destiny estimation of the securities trade is called a monetary trade expectation. The expectation is relied upon to be hearty, actual and effective. The framework ought to paintings as in step with the real conditions and need to be suitable to genuine settings. The framework is moreover anticipated to don’t forget all of the elements which can have an impact on
the inventory’s really well worth and execution.

In summary, the code demonstrates the application of LSTM for stock price prediction, including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization. It provides a basic framework for building LSTM models for time series forecasting tasks.

The code uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting. The model is trained on historical stock data, and it learns to identify patterns in the data that can be used to predict future prices.

The code first imports the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Keras. The Pandas library is used to read the stock data from a CSV file. The NumPy library is used to perform mathematical operations on the data. The Matplotlib library is used to create visualizations of the data. The Keras library is used to build and train the LSTM model.

# **Algorithums :-
**
The following algorithms are used in the code:

Time Series Split: This algorithm is used to split the data into training and testing sets. The algorithm works by dividing the data into k folds, where k is the number of splits. The first fold is used for training, the second fold is used for testing, and so on. This process is repeated until all of the folds have been used for both training and testing.


**Min Max Scaler:** 
This algorithm is used to scale the data between 0 and 1. The algorithm works by finding the minimum and maximum values in the data, and then subtracting the minimum value from each data point and dividing the result by the range (maximum value - minimum value).

**LSTM:** This algorithm is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting. The algorithm works by learning to identify patterns in the data that can be used to predict future values.

**Mean Squared Error (MSE):** This algorithm is used to measure the error between the predicted values and the actual values. The algorithm works by squaring the difference between each predicted value and the corresponding actual value, and then averaging the results.
R-squared (R2) Score: This algorithm is used to measure the goodness of fit of the model. The algorithm works by comparing the variance of the predicted values to the variance of the actual values. A value of 1 indicates that the model perfectly fits the data.
In addition to these algorithms, the code also uses the following libraries:

Pandas: This library is used to read the data from a CSV file.

NumPy: This library is used to perform mathematical operations on the data.

Matplotlib: This library is used to create visualizations of the data.

Keras: This library is used to build and train the LSTM model.

The code works by first importing the necessary libraries. The code then reads the stock data into a Pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is then cleaned and preprocessed. The data is scaled using a MinMaxScaler, and it is split into training and testing sets.

The LSTM model is then built. The model has a single LSTM layer with 32 units. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error loss function.

The model is then trained on the training data. The model is trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 8.

The model is then evaluated on the testing data. The model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0001 and an R-squared (R2) score of 0.99.

The results are then visualized. The actual stock prices are plotted along with the predicted stock prices. The plot shows that the model is able to accurately predict the future stock prices.

**Recent Advances and Application:-**

Recent advances in LSTM models for stock price prediction include:

•	Attention mechanisms: Attention mechanisms allow LSTM models to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data. This can be particularly helpful for stock price prediction, as it allows the model to focus on the most recent and relevant information.
•	Bidirectional LSTMs: Bidirectional LSTMs can process input data in both the forward and backward directions. This can be helpful for stock price prediction, as it allows the model to learn from both past and future data.
•	Ensemble models: Ensemble models combine multiple LSTM models into a single model. This can be helpful for stock price prediction, as it can reduce the variance of the predictions.
Recent applications of LSTM models for stock price prediction include:
•	Intraday trading: LSTM models can be used to predict short-term stock price movements. This can be helpful for traders who are looking to make quick profits.
•	Portfolio management: LSTM models can be used to create investment portfolios that are designed to outperform the market.
•	Risk management: LSTM models can be used to identify and manage risks associated with stock investing.
